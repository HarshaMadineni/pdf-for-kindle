Few Python scripts to crop and edit a pdf to view it comfortably on a Kindle device or any other E-book reader.
Use pdf_page_crop.py to crop the pdf pages as much as possible or preferred.
Then use pdf_page_half.py to cut all the pdf pages into half to comfortably view them horizontally on your e-reader.
Finally use pdf_bookmark.py to add bookmarks to the new pdf to access the chapter easily.
