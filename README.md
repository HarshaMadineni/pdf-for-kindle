# pdf-for-kindle
Few Python scripts that I use to crop and edit a pdf to view it comfortably on my Kindle.
Use pdf_page_crop.py to crop the pdf pages as much as possible or preferred.
Then use pdf_page_half.py to cut all the pdf pages into half to comfortably view them horizontally on your e-reader.
Finally use pdf_bookmark.py to add bookmarks to the new pdf to access the chapter easily.
